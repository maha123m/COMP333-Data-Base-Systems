# COMP333-Data-Base-Systems

## Project Idea 

      This project aims to develop a comprehensive database software system for a driving school based in Tulkarem called Al-Madina
      to efficiently manage their operations and their administrative tasks since they don’t have a software system and just use bunch
      of papers and pens to manage all data they have which obviously takes lots of time and efforts and sometimes ends up with lots of 
      mistaken information and calculations.
      
      The database system will be designed to handle various aspects of the driving school's operations, including student registration,
      scheduling of driving lessons, tracking progress of each student, managing instructors and vehicles, and generating useful reports.
      
      The driving school database system will have a user-friendly interface that allows administrators to easily store, update, delete
      and retrieve data related to students, instructors, vehicles, and lessons. That way we can help them improve their systems and avoid
      making mistakes. 



## Data Requirements
      • The student has: student id, student name (Quadruple name), date of birth, pictures (applied or not), gender, address,
        phone number, enrollment date, enrollment status (active or completed or canceled), payment status (full, partial),
        lessons completed,lessons remaining, trainer assigned, vehicle assigned, test result (Pass or fail), date of test,
        eyes test, license type, feedback after taking the test. Each student must have on trainer, and one trainer could have many students.
        
        • The trainer has: trainer id, trainer name, phone number, email, address,
          qualifications, availability (days and hours available), rating, number of vehicles
          owns. Each trainer can have many lessons with many students.
        
        • The lesson has: lesson id, lesson date, lesson time, lesson status (cancelled, completed), lesson duration,
          lesson cost, lesson location (parking, highway, city driving). Each lesson is assigned to one student, one trainer, and one vehicle.
        
        • The vehicle has: plate number, vehicle model, exterior color, production year, mileage, engine size, transmission 
          type (manual or automatic or truck or bus), fuel type (gasoline, diesel, electric, hybrid), Insurance date, License 
          date. Each vehicle can be assigned to many lessons, and each lesson can have one vehicle.



## Summary
      
      This project will be a driving school management system, as learning to drive has become an  important skill 
      in today's world. The idea of this project came to us because students and  driving trainers have trouble keeping
      track of their lessons, schedules, and progress.Therefore, we decided to create an application that arranges all the necessary 
      information for both the students and trainers. For Al-Madina driving school in Tulkarem.

##  Technology

      In our project we will use Java language through Eclipse IDE with Scene Builder for building user interfaces,
      and MySQL (SQL language) for building the database system. All users will share the same code using GitHub where 
      each user has their own pc with an operating system of windows 10.
